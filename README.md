## About

I realized I somewhat often want to alphabetize a list, so I figured it'd be nice to have a quick solution I drafted up myself rather than looking online, or even worse, doing it manually &#129314;

## Usage

Use `onclick` event of `<input>` to pass in the `id` of the `<textarea>` containing strings to alphabetize, and the `id` of the `<p>` where we will display the sorted list of strings

```html
<input type="submit" value="Alphabetize" onclick="alphabetize('strings', 'result');">
```
